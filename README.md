# InputData
Sea level pressure (SLP), skin temperature (SKT), mixed layer depth (MLD), and u/v fluxes (U/VFLX) data for inputting into the SOMS.  Grid data for each of these variables is also included - lat, lon, and 'seainds' giving the indices of where in the grid the variable data are from (because SOM will not tolerate columns of NaNs). In the SOM Rscript, all of these files are located in a ../PhysicalData/Averages_Reshaped directory, which can be created or renamed by the individual user to store these averages and grid files.
