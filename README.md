# InputData
Sea level pressure (SLP), skin temperature (SKT), mixed layer depth (MLD), and u/v fluxes (U/VFLX) data for inputting into the SOMS.  Grid data for each of these variables is also included - lat, lon, and 'seainds' giving the indices of where in the grid the variable data are from (because SOM will not tolerate columns of NaNs).
